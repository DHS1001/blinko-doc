## Why should i use Blinko?

After trying out numerous lightweight note-taking apps, I realized that my needs for note-taking are actually quite simple:
 - Quick creation, 
 - Easy tag management, 
 - Batch operations, 
 - Automatic cleanup of reviewed ideas
 - A convenient way to reflect on daily records
 
 Most importantly, I want to be able to find specific notes quickly, even after accumulating a large number. This insight led to the creation of **Blinko**. Blinkoâ€™s goal is to help users capture and manage their ideas effortlessly, and it is designed with two core sections: **"Blinko"** and **"Notes"**.

**"Blinko"** section is crafted for capturing quick flashes of inspiration. Users can jot down spontaneous ideas instantly without worrying about format or complex operations. These records can be set to automatically clear at intervals, ensuring that the content doesnâ€™t pile up excessively, keeping the section clean and efficient.  

**"Notes"** section provides a more organized management system where users can categorize notes with tags and utilize batch operations to easily organize and classify a large volume of notes.

To help users more effectively review and make use of their notes, Blinko integrates an AI-powered search feature. No matter how much content has been recorded, users can rely on smart search to find related notes in a short time, saving time on browsing. This not only improves the efficiency of finding information but also recommends relevant records based on keywords, helping users uncover hidden connections and inspiration within their notes.

The primary intent behind Blinkoâ€™s design is to make note-taking simpler, allowing users to focus on the content itself without being bogged down by excessive management tasks. Whether capturing sudden inspiration or systematically organizing notes, Blinko aims to deliver an intelligent, streamlined recording experience.
