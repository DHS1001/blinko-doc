# AI

In today's era of rapid AI development, efficient and high-speed knowledge base search has become indispensable for enhancing user experience and productivity. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there is an increasing demand for intelligent retrieval and precise answers to complex queries. To address this, **Blinko** has pioneered the use of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (RAG) technology, offering users an intelligent knowledge search and Q&A service. This capability not only simplifies the information retrieval process but also enhances the handling of complex questions, making Blinko a unique solution in modern knowledge management.

## How Blinko Leverages RAG Technology

Blinko’s RAG-based system combines knowledge retrieval with language generation in an innovative manner. In essence, RAG transforms user questions into understandable queries, retrieves relevant information from the knowledge base, and then uses a large language model to provide answers. This dual approach ensures that the responses are not only based on the model's internal knowledge but also on specific retrieved content, achieving high relevance and reliability. This process is ideal for scenarios that require quick access to extensive information, such as professional knowledge queries or everyday questions. Blinko is equipped to provide targeted answers across a range of topics efficiently.

## Why Blinko Doesn't Use Bidirectional Linking

Notably, Blinko does not incorporate a **bidirectional linking** feature, as the powerful retrieval capabilities of RAG adequately address the vast majority of knowledge retrieval needs. While traditional bidirectional linking can establish complex knowledge networks, it often relies on manual user inputs, which can become cumbersome and inefficient with large volumes of information. By combining RAG with LLMs, Blinko can automatically generate links or references to related content, making knowledge base usage more natural and seamless. This eliminates the need for users to manually maintain bidirectional links, offering a more efficient and precise search experience.

## Conclusion

In summary, Blinko’s use of RAG technology has enabled intelligent knowledge retrieval and efficient Q&A, providing users with an automated, streamlined knowledge acquisition experience.
